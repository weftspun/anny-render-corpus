"""Re-measure every number the README asserts, and fail if reality has moved.

WHY THIS EXISTS. A README rots silently: the code changes, the numbers stay, and nobody
finds out until someone builds on a figure that stopped being true. This project has
already produced one actively misleading README -- `godot-soma-twist` opened with "no
custom code is needed, Godot already ships the correct solution" long after the shipping
answer had become the opposite -- and one docstring that claimed Delta Mush was "available
here" when grep found zero occurrences of it.

So the README's numbers are not prose. They are tagged claims:

    <!--claim:twist_rmse_90_L=3.6 tol=1.0-->

and this script re-derives each one from the live code and compares. Drift is a test
failure, not a discovery six months later. That is the whole mechanism: being wrong makes
the documentation fail loudly, which is what makes it worth trusting when it passes.

Usage:  python check_readme_claims.py [README.md]
Exit code is non-zero if any claim has drifted, so it can gate CI.

A claim with no measurement function registered is reported as UNVERIFIED rather than
skipped -- a silent skip reads exactly like a pass, which is a failure mode this project
has hit three separate times.
